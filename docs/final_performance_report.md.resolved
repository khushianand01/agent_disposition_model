## 💡 Understanding the Metrics

To understand these scores, we use two primary industry-standard metrics:

*   **Precision (Trustworthiness)**: "When the model says it's a 'Renegotiate' request, how often is it right?"
    *   *High Precision* means you can trust the automation to act without human review.
*   **Recall (Coverage)**: "How many of the actual 'Renegotiate' requests hidden in the calls did the model find?"
    *   *High Recall* means you are capturing almost all opportunities and missing very little.
